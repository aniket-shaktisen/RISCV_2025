1. Setup and Hold Timing Checks

Setup Time :
Definition: Minimum time data must be stable before the active clock edge.
Ensures data is properly latched.
Violation → Data is not captured correctly (timing too tight).

Hold Time :
Definition: Minimum time data must remain stable after the active clock edge.
Ensures data doesn’t change too early.
Violation → Data changes too soon and may corrupt the latch.

2. Slack

Slack = Required Time – Arrival Time
  Positive Slack: Timing is met.
  Zero Slack: Circuit is on the edge of violating timing.
  Negative Slack: Timing violation exists.

Separate slacks for:
  Setup Slack: Arrival time should be ≤ Required time.
  Hold Slack: Arrival time should be ≥ Required time.

3. Clock Definitions

it includes.. 
 Clock source and period (e.g., create_clock)
 Waveform shape (rise/fall)
 Clock uncertainty (jitter, skew)
 Clock latency (source/propagated delay)

Clock influences:
  Timing checks (start & end points)
  Setup/Hold paths
  Derating, skew, uncertainty in analysis

4. Path-Based Analysis

STA tools analyze timing paths from launch to capture points.
  Launch edge: When data is launched (start of path)
  Capture edge: When data is captured (end of path)
Common path types:
  Data Path: Sequential start → combinational → sequential end
  Clock Path: Clock tree delay to launch/capture flip-flops
Types of paths:  
  Setup paths (check max delay)
  Hold paths (check min delay)

Path-based analysis checks every timing path individually, Captures exact behavior, including :
  Path delays, Skew, Constraints
